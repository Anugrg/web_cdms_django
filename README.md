Effectively managing climatological, hydrological and other environmental data commonly
referred as Earth system data is crucial for earth observations monitoring, analysis,
modeling and prediction - at the national, regional and global levels - and is essential for the
effective, timely provision of related services. One of the most important to manage Earth
system data effectively is having a state-of-the-art Climate Data Management System
(CDMS), where ‘Climate’ is considered to be inclusive of Earth system data with a time-
series component.
With the advent of new technologies, an online CDMS can assist meteorologists and
hydrologists in providing instantaneous analysis, data assimilation, and backup support and
encourage inter-sectoral data exchange. Components of web-based CDMS are described
below:

- Observation Data Component
- Interface Layer
- Data Quality Control Component
- Spatial Data Generation Component
- BUFR export/import component
